Advancing the accuracy of anti-MRSA peptide prediction through integrating multi-source protein language model.

pLM4MRSA is a pLM-based framework designed to improve the accurate prediction of anti-MRSA peptides. 

In pLM4MRSA, we utilize feature embeddings derived from various pLMs, including evolutionary-scale modeling (ESM-2) and ProtTrans, which offer complementary information for predicting anti-MRSA peptides. Then, we integrate the individual strengths of multiple pLMs to create hybrid feature embeddings and apply principal component analysis (PCA) for processing. Finally, the PCA-transformed feature vectors were generated and used as inputs for model construction.
